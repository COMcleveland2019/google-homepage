I enjoyed working on this project despite still being very raw to both HTML and CSS. 
I did learn a lot and look forward to hopefully coming back to this at some point in 
the future and laughing at how much of a challange it was for me.Doing this project 
made it clear that the only way to hone my skills will be through repetition and I will 
be reviewing all the course work thus far before moving ahead.
